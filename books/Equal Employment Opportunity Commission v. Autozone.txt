                                        ARGUMENT

In its principal cross-appeal brief, the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") contended that the EEOC properly 
objected on the record to the retaliation instruction that limited the adverse action 
to whether Stacy Wing's promotion had been withdrawn. EEOC Br. at 2-3. The 
Commission further contended that the district court abused its discretion when it 
failed to include the denial of promotion as an adverse action in its retaliation 
instruction because the record contained substantial evidence that Wing had been 
denied a promotion because she complained about Jose Contreras' sexual 
harassment.  Id. at 57-58.  Finally, the Commission contended that the district 
court's error was prejudicial because, if the jury had been properly instructed, it 
might have reached a different conclusion since proof that Wing had secured the 
promotion is not necessary for a denial claim and the evidence could have 
supported a finding that AutoZone retaliated against Wing by denying her a 
promotion for complaining about the harassment.  Id. at 55, 59-61.  Accordingly, 
the EEOC urged this Court to reverse the trial court's judgment on the retaliation 
claim and remand that claim for a new trial.

In response, AutoZone asserts that the district court's jury instruction on the 
retaliation claim was correct for three reasons.  First, AutoZone asserts that the 
EEOC waived any objection it had to the jury instruction on retaliation because the 
Commission did not make a proper objection "during either of the two jury 
conferences held on the record."  AZ Resp. Br. at 23.  AutoZone notes that while 
both the EEOC and AutoZone objected to certain proposed jury instructions when 
they were submitted to the district court prior to trial, the EEOC did not object 
during the charge conference.  Id. at 21.  

Second, AutoZone asserts that, because Wing's EEOC charge alleged that 
she had been demoted from the PSM position and the EEOC's complaint alleged 
that AutoZone had withdrawn Wing's promotion to the PSM position, neither the 
EEOC nor Wing ever asserted that the retaliation claim was based on a failure to 
promote.  AZ Resp. Br.  at 24. Thus, even if the EEOC had preserved an objection 
to the jury instruction, "it should not be permitted to assert a new claim on appeal."  
Id. at 23.   AutoZone further avers that the denial of a promotion claim was not at 
issue in the case because, in the Pre-Trial Order, the EEOC stated that the only 
basis for retaliation was the alleged withdrawal of Wing's promotion. Id.

Finally, AutoZone contends that, in any case, the jury instruction was 
appropriate because the EEOC cannot "point to any record evidence that would 
support a failure to promote claim" since Wing was not qualified for the PSM 
position, "an essential element of a failure to promote (or denial of a promotion) 
claim."  Id. at 25.  Additionally, AutoZone asserts that "there is no record evidence 
of any retaliatory intent on behalf of AutoZone" because "Wing testified that she 
did not even begin her alleged training until after she complained about Mr. 
Contreras in mid-2003," and there is evidence she received favorable treatment 
after she complained. Id. at 26 (emphasis in original).

In making these arguments, which are simply incorrect, AutoZone ignores 
most of the points made in the Commission's opening brief.  Accordingly, the 
Commission urges this Court to reverse the adverse judgment on the retaliation 
claim and remand it for a new trial.
a. The Commission did properly object on the record to the jury instructions 
on the retaliation claim and therefore has not waived its objection. EEOC Br. at 2-
3.  Rule 51(c) (1) states: "A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to 
give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected 
to and the grounds for the objection." Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c) (1).  Rule 51(c)(2)(A) 
adds that "[a]n objection is timely if: a party objects at the opportunity provided 
under Rule 51(b)(2)." Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(2)(A).  Finally, Rule 51(d)(1) clarifies 
that "[a] party may assign as error: (A) an error in an instruction actually given, if 
that party properly objected; or (B) a failure to give an instruction, if that party 
properly requested it and - unless the court rejected the request in a definitive 
ruling on the record - also properly objected.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(A)(B).  In 
other words, according to the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 51(d)(B), a court 
has the authority to "review the failure to grant a timely request, despite a failure to 
add an objection, when the court has made a definitive ruling on the record 
rejecting the request."  Federal Civil Judicial Procedures and Rules 239 (West 
2010 ed.).

At the district court's direction, ESSER at 2, and in compliance with Rule 51 
(a)(1),<1> the EEOC submitted several months before the trial a proposed jury 
instruction that clearly indicated the adverse action for the retaliation claim was 
that "Defendant denied Ms. Wing a promotion to a Part Sales Manager position[.]"  
II-SER-107; EEOC Br. at 59.  Additionally, the Commission objected to 
AutoZone's jury instruction, which excluded the denial of promotion claim, and 
explained that describing the adverse action as a demotion "inaccurately reflect[ed] 
the EEOC's allegations in this case and the Court's ruling on Defendant's Motion 
for summary judgment, which concludes that EEOC has alleged that defendant 
denied Ms. Wing a promotion and that this denial is an adverse employment action. 
Plaintiff has proposed an alternative instruction, above."  Id. at 110.  Given that the 
EEOC clearly requested that the denial of promotion claim be included in the jury 
instruction at the time the district court ordered such submission, and it registered 
an objection to the exclusion of the denial of promotion claim when confronted 
with AutoZone's proposed instruction, the EEOC "object[ed] at the opportunity 
provided," Rule 51(c)(2)(A), and fully apprised the district court of its position.  
Smith v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, 147 F.3d 272, 278 (3d Cir.1998) (preserving 
objection made at in camera charging conference under Rule 51 because "the 
district court was fully apprised of [the party's] position, and it would serve no 
purpose to require counsel to have formally reasserted the objection after the 
charge had been given to the jury"). 

The EEOC also effectively objected "on the record" to the exclusion of the 
denial of promotion claim. On the first day of the trial, the court inquired as to 
whether there were any objections to the draft preliminary jury instructions which 
included the denial of promotion claim.  ASER at 2; I-SER-30.  AutoZone 
objected, arguing that the EEOC had agreed in its pretrial order to characterize the 
adverse action as a withdrawal of promotion.  Id.  In rebuttal, the EEOC stated that, 
as it had set forth its position in the summary judgment pleadings, the evidence 
indicated Wing's promotion had been "denied and withdrawn."  Id. When 
questioned as to whether Wing's position was that the promotion had been 
withdrawn, the EEOC clarified that, while the facts could be characterized as either 
a denial or a withdrawal of the promotion, "there's evidence that she was told she 
would not be promoted."   Id. at 3.  More discussion on the topic ensued:
THE COURT: I understand that. But was she told that she wasn't 
being promoted because someone else had said you are 
promoted? Or did they say, we intend to promote you, and then 
they said, we're not going to promote you?
MR. LOPEZ: Well, I think -- I think at some point she was -- it 
was represented to her that she would be promoted, and they did 
not promote her.

Id.  The EEOC's position was that the evidence would support a finding that 
throughout the course of Wing's tenure with AutoZone she had variously been 
either denied a promotion or had a promotion withdrawn such that the jury 
instructions should include both retaliatory acts.  Accordingly, the Commission 
fulfilled its Rule 51 obligation to state on the record its objection to the jury 
instruction requested by AutoZone and the grounds for the objection. 

Under these circumstances, it is immaterial that the EEOC was not the party 
to actually initiate an objection to the court's draft jury instructions.  Because the 
draft jury instruction presented to the parties contained the language the EEOC 
sought to be included, i.e. the denial of promotion claim, there was no basis for the 
EEOC to initiate an objection.  Instead, and as expected, AutoZone initiated the 
objection and the EEOC made clear to the court through its opposition that it 
objected to the proposed exclusion of the denial of promotion claim from the 
instruction.  Therefore, the EEOC's objections, which were on the record,  were 
sufficient to challenge the revised instructions that were ultimately docketed and 
which excluded the denial of promotion instruction.  A contrary view would not 
only exalt form over substance but would result in a the unjust exclusion of  a 
claim well founded in the evidence produced at trial.

Furthermore, for reasons based firmly in well settled rules of  practice, the 
Commission was not required to make any further objections in order to preserve 
this point of error for appeal. By issuing  a retaliation instruction that excluded the 
denial of promotion claim,  II-SER-102,  the district court made a "definitive ruling 
on the record" that relieved the EEOC from registering future objections to the 
erroneous jury instruction.  "The failure to object [at the close of the charge] may 
be disregarded if the party's position previously has been made clear to the trial 
judge and it is plain that a further objection would be unavailing."). See 9A Charles 
A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2553 at 411 (2d 
ed. 1995), quoted in Smith, 147 F.3d at 277 (by filing and obtaining ruling on 
proposed instruction, litigant satisfies rule requiring objection to the charge before 
jury retires to consider its verdict, and litigant does not waive objections to 
instructions by failing to restate them following delivery of the charge; counsel 
need not restate an objection that has already been raised and ruled upon).  Indeed, 
the record is clear that the district court was aware of the Commission's request 
that the retaliation instruction include a denial of promotion as an adverse action 
and that the court conveyed its rejection of that request by excluding that claim 
from its docketed instruction.

Finally, AutoZone's argument that the EEOC lodged no objection during the 
final charge conference is disingenuous.  Prior to charging the jury, the district 
court again invited the parties to critique the jury instructions.  Once again, the 
draft jury instructions included the denial of promotion claim; hence, the 
Commission did not raise an objection. ESSER-53-55.   AutoZone, on the other 
hand, objected to the court's inclusion of the denial of promotion claim.  
Specifically, during the final charge conference, AutoZone objected  to "[t]he word 
'denying' in paragraph two, line eight" of the retaliation instruction and insisted 
that "[i]t should read either withdrawing and/or demoting in that paragraph, to be 
consistent with the preliminary instructions." II-SER-71.  When asked by the court 
if it agreed with AutoZone's statement, the Commission said, "I think our position 
is preserved." Id.<2>

Although  the Commission's response may seem vague, the Commission, as 
already discussed, had already objected to the exclusion of the denial of promotion 
claim from the instructions and repeatedly stated, during the summary judgment, 
pre-trial, and trial proceedings, its position that the retaliatory acts in the case 
included both a denial and withdrawal of a promotion.   Further, despite the 
Commission's reiterations of its denial of promotion theory, the district court had 
repeatedly rejected the Commission's requests to include the claim in the 
instructions as evidenced by the docketed versions of the preliminary, final, and 
revised jury instructions on the retaliation claim. II-SER-69, 99-101.  As a result, 
the Commission believes a fair interpretation of its actions supports the conclusion 
that, in accordance with the purpose of Rule 51, the EEOC had exhausted its duty 
to inform the court of the potential error in restricting the jury instructions to the 
withdrawal of promotion claim and to provide the court an opportunity to correct 
it. See Voohries-Larson v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 241 F.3d 707, 713 (9th Cir.2001) 
("The purpose of Rule 51 is to alert the district court that an instruction is 
defective."); see also Franklin Prescriptions, Inc. v. New York Times Co., 424 F.3d 
336, 340 (3d Cir. 2005) ("Rule 51 serves the critical purpose of apprising the trial 
court of possible errors in the charge and affording the court and the parties an 
opportunity for correction before submission of the case to the jury.).  Therefore, 
this Court should conclude that the objection was made and preserved on the 
record.

Because the EEOC "preserved" its position regarding the inclusion of the 
denial of the promotion claim, International House of Pancakes, Inc. v. Twin City 
Fire Insurance Company, 19 Fed. Appx. 686 (9th Cir. 2001), is distinguishable and 
AutoZone's reliance on that case is misplaced.  AZ Resp. Br. at 22.  In that case, 
when the court provided the parties an opportunity to comment on revised jury 
instructions, the plaintiff did not make an objection but instead responded that the 
instructions, it later attempted to challenge, were "satisfactory."  Id. at 687.  Here, 
in contrast, EEOC did not make an objection because the draft version of the final 
jury instructions included the instruction requested by the Commission. II-SER-71. 
In addition, the Commission never stated that it was satisfied, but rather expressed 
its objection to AutoZone's proposal that the denial of promotion claim be 
excluded when it stated to the court that it "preserved" its position.  Id.  

This case is also unlike Snake River Valley Elec. Ass'n v. PacifiCorp,
357 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2004).  In Snake River, the plaintiff participated in three 
jury charge conferences, of which only the third was formal and on the record.  At 
that conference, the plaintiff objected to an error in the instruction that was 
different from the errors it noted in its appeal, and its general objection to the 
instructions in the earlier conferences lacked the specificity required to put the 
court on notice that the plaintiff opposed the alternative jury instruction.  
Consequently, this Court held that the plaintiff's assignments of error were waived.  
Id. at 1053.  In this case, in contrast, the EEOC voiced explicit objections to the 
exclusion of the denial of a promotion claim and it presented specific reasons for 
including the claim to the district court during AutoZone's challenge to the draft 
preliminary and final instructions.  Hence, it cannot be said that the district court 
was not "alerted to the exact nature of the disagreement" by the time the 
Commission expressed belief that it had preserved its position at the final charge 
conference.  Prendeville v. Singer, 155 Fed. Appx. 303, 306 (9th Cir. 2005).  
Accordingly, this Court should find that the Commission did not waive its right to 
appeal the formulation of the instruction.

Alternatively, even if this Court agrees that "the EEOC did not make any 
objection to the jury instruction during either of the two jury conferences held on 
the record," AZ Resp. Br. at 23, the Commission has not waived its objection to the 
retaliation instruction because its initial objections during the pretrial stages 
established the grounds for the Commission's objections with specificity and 
rendered any further objections futile.  IHOP, 19 Fed. Appx. at 687 ("the Ninth 
Circuit does not require a formal objection where such an objection would be 
futile").   As previously discussed,  Rule 51(d)(1)(B) excuses a party's failure to 
object on the record where "the court made a definitive ruling on the record 
rejecting the request." Fed. R. Civ. P.  51(d)(1)(B).  Here, the record reflects that, 
despite the Commission's efforts to advance the denial of promotion claim and 
have it included in the jury instructions, the district court continued to issue and 
docket jury instructions that restricted the adverse action in the retaliation 
instruction to a withdrawal of promotion.  II-SER-69, 99-101.  Hence, even if the 
Commission's pre-trial objections and first day of trial contentions about the 
retaliatory acts at issue in the case are not considered "on the record" and its 
"preserved" position in the final charge conference is not considered sufficiently 
definitive in accordance with Rule 51(c)(1), this Court nonetheless should consider 
the Commission's point of error  preserved because the district court had 
definitively ruled against the Commission on the issue.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.  
51(d)(1)(B).  As the Ninth Circuit observed in United States  v. Leal-Cruz, 431 F.3d 
667 (9th  Cir. 2005), "[d]espite counsel's failure to articulate clearly her position at 
the final jury instruction conference, we conclude that her failure to object formally 
to the given instruction does not rise to the level of an affirmative relinquishment 
or abandonment of Leal-Cruz's right to challenge the instruction on appeal." Id. at 
669-70.  Therefore, the Commission is entitled to have its objection to the 
retaliation instruction reviewed in this appeal. 
b. AutoZone's contention that district court properly instructed the jury 
because a denial of promotion claim was never before the court is specious. AZ 
Resp. Br. at 20. The denial of promotion claim has always been at issue in this 
case.  The record establishes that the EEOC has advanced the denial of promotion 
claim, explicitly and implicitly, throughout this litigation. See EEOC Br. at 56-59.  
However, AutoZone, throughout this litigation, and even now on appeal, has 
continued to misconstrue the Commission's retaliation claim. 
	
AutoZone asserts that the "scope of this lawsuit is governed by the 
allegations Ms. Wing made in her charge" and because Ms. Wing's charge to the 
EEOC only alleged she was demoted in retaliation for her complaints, the 
Commission's suit is accordingly limited.  AZ Resp. Br. at 24.  This argument lacks 
merit. As the Supreme Court recognized, the EEOC is the "master of its case," 
EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 291 (2002), and "[a]ny violations the 
EEOC ascertains in the course of a reasonable investigation of the charging party's 
complaint are actionable."  General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 331 
(1980).  Thus, "[t]he permissible scope of an EEOC lawsuit is not confined to the 
specific allegations in the charge." EEOC v. Delight Wholesale Co., 973 F.2d 664, 
668 (8th Cir. 1992).   Instead, the Commission's lawsuit "may extend to any 
discrimination like or related to the substance of the allegations in the charge and 
which reasonably can be expected to grow out of the investigation triggered by the 
charge."  Id.  Here, Wing alleged in her charge that she had been demoted from the 
PSM job because she complained about sexual harassment.  ASER at 1.  However, 
the Commission's investigation uncovered other potential retaliatory acts, 
including a denial and withdrawal of a promotion to the PSM job, similarly 
resulting from AutoZone's reaction to her complaints about being sexually 
harassed.  The denial and withdrawal claims are clearly like or related to the 
substance of Wing's EEOC charge because they rest on similar facts concerning 
the PSM position, involve the same actors, and are tied to her complaint of sexual 
harassment.  Accordingly, the Commission has the authority to sue based on the 
failure to promote claims.

Next, AutoZone argues that the denial of promotion claim was not properly 
before the district court because "[i]n the complaint, the EEOC alleged that 
AutoZone withdrew its promotion of Ms. Wing to a PSM position."  AZ Resp. Br. 
at 24.  As it did throughout the litigation, AutoZone again on appeal 
mischaracterizes and misquotes the Commission's complaint.  As the Commission 
repeatedly reminded the court and AutoZone throughout this litigation, the 
complaint states that "Defendants' unlawful retaliation includes but is not limited 
to withdrawing Ms. Wing's promotion to a Parts Service Manager or a Parts Sales 
Manager position." II-SER-116 (emphasis added).  The broader language of 
"includes but not limited to" conveys that other retaliatory acts were at issue in this 
action beyond the withdrawal of promotion claim.  Indeed, at the summary 
judgment stage, in addition to asserting facts in support of the denial of promotion 
claim, I-SER-35, the Commission also asserted that AutoZone had retaliated by 
denying Wing a day off and scheduling her for four consecutive day shifts.  Id. at 
34.  
    
Further, even though AutoZone correctly argues that, in the Pre-Trial Order, 
the EEOC mentioned only the withdrawal of promotion claim in its description of 
the retaliation claim, AZ Resp. Br. at 24; ASER at 195, 207, especially in this 
context, such inartful drafting should not thoroughly doom an entire claim. While 
"[a] pretrial order governs the subsequent course of the action," a district court 
may allow modifications of the issues in the proceedings "to prevent manifest 
injustice." Bristol Locknut Co. v. SPS Tech., Inc., 677 F.2d 1277, 1279 (9th Cir. 
1982).  Here, despite the pretrial order, the Commission's complaint provided 
sufficient notice that the retaliation claim encompassed more than the withdrawal 
of the promotion claim.  II-SER-116.  Even the district court recognized this claim 
was in the case when, during the summary judgment proceedings, the  court stated 
"Wing believes she was denied a promotion" and concluded that "[i]f she believed 
the denial was a punitive measure resulting from her complaints, it 'might have 
dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of 
discrimination,' and constitute an adverse employment action."  I-SER-48.  The 
Commission introduced and the district court properly allowed evidence on the 
denial of promotion claim and other allegedly retaliatory acts at trial from both 
parties.   III-SER-335, 340-42, 354; ESSER-24, 30, 33-35. AutoZone never 
claimed surprise or prejudice when the EEOC presented its argument and evidence 
on the denial of promotion claim during the trial  AutoZone merely pressed its 
position that the alleged adverse action in the case was a demotion or withdrawal 
of promotion. ESSER-4-6.  The Commission continued to advance its theory even 
after the district court issued a preliminary jury instruction limiting the adverse 
action to a withdrawal of promotion claim.  Indeed, in addition to testimony by 
Wing regarding the three occasions she was told she would not receive the PSM 
promotion because she had complained, EEOC Br. at 58; See III-SER-335, 340-42, 
354, the Commission reiterated the facts supporting the denial of a promotion 
theory.
     
In response to AutoZone's Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, 
the EEOC countered by pointing to testimonial evidence that Wing asked 
Contreras if she would be promoted and he said no because she told on him in 
June.  II-SER-87.  The Commission also pointed to the denial of promotion by 
Brown and Schmitt.  Id.  With respect to the tangible employment action claim, the 
Commission referenced the same facts regarding the three managers' refusal to 
promote Wing and asserted that "[a] reasonable jury could conclude that she was 
denied the promotion as a result of harassment by her supervisor." Id. at 86.  Given 
that facts supporting the tangible employment action for the hostile work 
environment claim and the adverse employment action for the retaliation claim 
were the same and were argued vigorously, it is clear that the Commission never 
abandoned its position regarding the promotion denial theory, but rather kept it a 
central issue in the case.

The Commission similarly made clear there were two separate adverse 
actions - denial of promotion and withdrawal of promotion -- when AutoZone 
renewed its Rule 50 motion following the closure of its case-in-chief.  Once again, 
AutoZone argued that there was no evidence that Wing was demoted or had a 
promotion withdrawn because there is no evidence that she ever held the position 
of PSM. ESSER-38-42, 52-53.  In rebuttal, the Commission emphasized the denial 
of the promotion theory.  Specifically, the Commission noted:  
They keep referring to the withdrawal of the PSM code as if that were 
the only act of alleged retaliation. It is not. Miss Wing testified that 
there was retaliation prior to December 2003 by Mr. Contreras when 
he told her, I am not going -- you are never going to get promoted to a 
PSM because you told on me. That is an adverse employment action. 

II-SER-72.  The Commission added:
Miss Wing has testified that Mr. Brown told her, you're not going to 
be promoted to PSM because you went outside the company, went to 
an outside agency and filed a charge of discrimination. That is an 
adverse employment action. 

ESSER-48.  
On this record, this Court should conclude that the Commission kept the 
denial of promotion claim before the district court and that AutoZone's argument 
that the only adverse employment action advanced by the EEOC was the "alleged 
demotion/withdrawal of a promotion from a PSM position," is unfounded.  AZ 
Resp. Br. at 25.
c. AutoZone argues that, even if its procedural objections are without merit, 
this Court should not find error with the jury instruction because "[t]he EEOC 
cannot point to any record evidence that would support a failure to promote claim."  
AZ Resp. Br. at 25.  AutoZone's argument is untenable.
    
The district court rejected AutoZone's argument that no evidence supported 
the retaliation claim when it denied its Rule 50(a) motion at the close of the 
Commission's case-in-chief.  I-SER-22, 28.  This is because the record contained 
Wing's testimony that she had been told on three separate occasions by 
management that she would not get the promotion to the PSM position because she 
had filed an internal grievance and an EEOC complaint about the sexual 
harassment.  See III-SER-335, 340-42, 354.  Wing's testimony, if credited, was 
sufficient to support, not only a jury instruction, but a favorable finding on the 
denial of a promotion theory.  Thus, AutoZone's argument that there is no 
evidence in the record to support the denial of promotion claim simply must fail.
    
AutoZone argues next that there was no error in the jury instruction on 
retaliation because "Wing was not qualified for the PSM position during her 
employment - an essential element of a failure to promote (or denial of a 
promotion) claim."  AZ Resp. Br. at 25.   According to AutoZone, the evidence is 
undisputed that Wing was not qualified for the PSM promotion because Wing was 
unable to identify any of the managers she shadowed during her training, she 
admitted that she did not perform certain PSM duties during her training, and she 
never completed training under the second store manager.  Id. at 25-26.  This 
argument is flawed.  
    
To send a retaliation claim to a jury, the plaintiff need only present sufficient 
evidence (1) that the employee opposed an unlawful employment practice; (2) that 
she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that the adverse employment 
action was caused by her opposition to the unlawful employment practice. 
McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1124 (9th Cir. 2004).  In other words, 
the only question on appeal is whether the EEOC presented sufficient evidence of 
retaliation, or more specifically, causation, to reach the jury.  Here, the 
Commission presented direct evidence that Wing's complaints of sexual 
harassment factored into AutoZone's decision not to promote her.  Indeed, Wing 
averred that she was told by Contreras that he would not seek a promotion for her 
because she had "told on him." III-SER-335, 354.  Because Contreras was the store 
manager and Wing's harasser, and he was authorized to make a promotion 
recommendation to district manager Goddard,<3> his statement alone is sufficient to 
support a finding of retaliatory intent.  Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 
F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) ("Causation can be inferred from timing alone 
where an adverse employment action follows on the heels of protected activity . . . 
. ") (quoting Paluck v. Gooding Rubber Co., 221 F.3d 1003, 1009-10 (7th Cir. 
2000)).  Additional evidence that Wing was told two more times by two managers 
that she would not receive the promotion because of her discrimination complaints 
bolsters a finding of retaliatory intent.   Hence, a reasonable jury could have 
decided that a retaliatory motive was at work. 
    
In addition, AutoZone's argument that a plaintiff asserting a retaliatory 
denial of  promotion claim must prove, presumably as part of the prima facie case, 
qualification for the job denied is a classic red herring.  AutoZone cites no 
authority for this assertion.  In this Circuit, to establish a prima facie case of 
retaliation in a denial of a promotion context, the plaintiff must show that Wing "1) 
. . . acted to protect  [her] Title VII rights; 2) that an adverse employment action 
was thereafter taken against [her]; and 3) that a causal link existed between the two 
events." McGinest, 360 F.3d at 1124.  
    
Further, AutoZone's contention that it is undisputed that there is no evidence 
that Wing was qualified for the job is baseless.  The record here contains evidence 
from which a finding could be made that Wing was qualified for the PSM position.  
First, given that AutoZone has no structure or set criteria for promotion to this 
position, Wing, like many of her general sales colleagues, would qualify for the 
position by, for example, simply doing a good job in her present job and "knowing 
the ropes."  In other words, the "qualification" standards for the PSM job were not 
especially rigorous and most good employees would qualify.  Furthermore, 
contrary to AutoZone's assertion that it is undisputed that Wing is not qualified, 
AZ Resp. Br. at 25, the evidence here is sufficient to allow a jury to believe that 
Wing was qualified for the promotion to PSM.  
    
The record is undisputed that Wing received PSM training. According to 
district manager Brian Goddard, the PSM training process occurs as follows: "If 
the store manager thinks the employee is promotable, then Goddard tells the store 
manager to get them trained up and ready to go.  There's no formal training.  They 
would shadow the manager.  They would take the extra effort that they needed to 
do.  Then, Goddard and the manager would talk and say, is he or she ready?   
Goddard would sit down and talk with them a few minutes and try figure out where 
they are."  ESSER-39.
    
Following this procedure, the record shows that Goddard directed store 
manager Jose Contreras to train Wing to become a PSM.  III-SER-332-33, 357-58.  
Wing testified that she completed the training guide that Contreras had given her 
and that she shadowed some managers.  Id. at 333-34, 353-54.  As a PSM, Josh 
Arias worked with Wing and thought she "was real professional and a good 
employee." ESSER-11.  Arias also testified that Contreras told him he thought 
Wing was qualified to be a PSM.  III-SER-266.  Additionally, Howard Brown 
testified that Wing, Hector and another employee "all said they were being trained 
as PSMs." ESSER-18.  He said he checked with his immediate predecessor, 
Derrick Edwards, and "he said that he was training them, but they were not in fact 
PSMs, he was just training them." Id. at 19.  Indeed, Brown continued to train 
Wing to be a PSM.  Id.
    
Lastly, Wing was given PSM responsibilities and had a password typically 
possessed by a PSM.  III-SER-336-37.  Barajas, an AutoZone employee who was a 
non-managerial employee like Wing during this period, testified that he and Wing 
were given a manager's password because there were no PSMs at Store 2737.  II-
SER-239; see also III-SER-336, 338.  Howard Brown, the store manager who 
permanently replaced Contreras, testified that while he does not recall whether 
there were any PSMs when he came to Store 2737, he does remember that "it was 
severely understaffed," including in management positions. ESSER-13. He also 
remembers Wing and Barajas putting in passwords for other employees - a 
responsibility that only PSMs could perform.  Id. at 17.  Brown testified that Wing 
and Barajas told him that they were in training to become PSMs and that they 
actually were performing some PSM duties. Id. at 22. From this evidence, a jury 
could conclude that given Wing's training, her completion of the training guide, 
and the PSM tasks she was performing, she was at a minimum within the pool of 
individuals from which AutoZone might likely select PSMs and was therefore 
sufficiently qualified for purposes of the Commission's retaliation claim. 

That Wing admitted she did not perform certain PSM tasks or possess the 
knowledge that certain duties were required of a PSM is far from fatal to the 
Commission's retaliation claim. The record indicates that there was no uniform 
approach to training employees to become a PSM.  Hector Barajas testified that he 
did not recall undergoing any formal or structured training to become a PSM. 
ESSER-7.  Instead, Barajas believed he was trained informally. Id.  Similarly, 
former PSM Arias testified that "there is maybe a set procedure that AutoZone 
would like employees or managers to follow as far as like promoting people, which 
you eventually do. But for the most part it seemed like it was mostly, you get 
promoted just depending on your knowledge, how you do. * * * I mean, you kind 
of just work your way up." Id. at 12.  Arias added that he "wasn't aware that there 
was some kind of a, you know, guideline or some kind of a book that I was 
supposed to do or anything like that." Id.  To become a PSM, Arias said he "tried 
to learn as much as I could as quick as I could. And I was always, I guess you can 
say, trying to - if I was done with a customer I'd try to get involved with somebody 
else if they were having a hard time and kind of together try to figure out what the 
problem was. Just learn the ropes, you can say." Id.  Interim store manager Derrick 
Edwards said he started off as a register, which is a part-time sales associate, and 
"kind of worked his way up to PSM."  Id. at 29. 
    
Relatedly, store manager Brown testified that "[a]ll store managers train the 
Parts Sales Managers" and the length of the training process depended on the 
person.  ESSER-14-15.  Brown also was not sure if there were written training 
requirements.  Id. at 15.  He recalled that at one time there was a binder you could 
print out and quizzes you could take on a computer, and he had found some old 
copies of a PSM Training Guide, which he used because it had some good basic 
knowledge." Id.  District manager Scott Schmitt testified that he told Wing that if 
she wanted to be promoted to a PSM, she needed "to work with her manager, to 
make sure she shows up and continues to do her duties, show up on time and get to 
work.  And work with her manager very closely.  * * * And then he would evaluate 
her position."  Id. at 32.  Therefore, even though Wing admitted that she did not 
perform certain PSM duties or recall the names of the managers she shadowed, the 
jury had the evidence before it to make credibility determinations and weigh the 
evidence, and could have concluded that Wing met the minimal qualifications for 
the promotion and would have received it but for her complaints about the sexual 
harassment.  In that Wing testified that she fulfilled many of the steps outlined by 
these managers and PSMs, her testimony combined with the lack of structure and 
uniformity in the training undermines AutoZone's argument that Wing was not 
qualified for the PSM job and further could have permitted the jury to conclude 
that her alleged lack of qualification was not the actual reason for her non-
promotion.  
d.  Lastly, AutoZone argues that the Commission's cross-appeal should not 
prevail because "there is no record evidence of retaliatory intent on behalf of 
AutoZone."  AZ Resp. Br. at 26.  AutoZone argues that evidence that Wing's 
training for the PSM position commenced after she complained about being 
sexually harassed, received a promotion from part-time to full-time status, and 
received another promotion to a commercial specialist position indicate that "the 
EEOC has not produced any evidence that AutoZone failed to promote Ms. Wing 
to a PSM position, let alone did so in retaliation for her complaint of harassment."  
Id.  AutoZone's argument lacks merit.
    
First, contrary to AutoZone's contention, the trial record contained evidence 
upon which a jury could easily find retaliatory intent.  Wing testified that managers 
Contreras, Brown, and Scott Schmitt told her she would not get the PSM 
promotion because she had complained about sexual harassment.  III-SER-335, 
340-42.  
    
Second, AutoZone's argument that the Commission cannot establish a 
retaliatory motive because Wing was offered PSM training after she complained 
makes no sense.  The claim at issue is not the denial of training but rather the 
denial of a promotion, and the evidence is clear that Wing was not given a 
promotion after she complained. Also, Brian Goddard, the district manager who 
offered Wing the opportunity to train as a PSM, was not aware of Wing's sexual 
harassment complaints, ESSER-38, nor was he implicated in Wing's allegations of 
retaliation.  Rather, Contreras, Brown and Schmitt were the persons charged with 
denying her the PSM promotion, and record evidence indicated that they were 
aware of her sexual harassment complaints.  III-SER-335, 342; ESSER-37.  
Accordingly, the fact that the training opportunity was offered after she 
complained is largely irrelevant to the retaliation claim.
    
Third, the record contained undisputed evidence that Wing worked for 
AutoZone for three years and was never promoted to PSM despite the fact that she 
had taken and completed PSM training twice and served in the position 
temporarily.  II-SER-86; III-SER-335-36.   In contrast, Josh Arias was promoted 
from a red shirt to PSM roughly 7 months after he was hired, and he was not aware 
a training handbook existed nor was required to undergo any formal training.  
ESSER-10-12.  Similarly, Hector Barajas was a red shirt who was eventually 
promoted to PSM by Scott Schmitt and he was not required to complete the 
training handbook or take any formal training. Id. at 7-9. On this evidence, a jury 
could decide that the evidence that these men, who hadn't engaged in any 
protected activity, were promoted despite the fact they did not possess the 
credentials or training experience Wing had, suggests that it was Wing's complaint 
of sexual harassment that motivated AutoZone's decision not to promote her.  
Hence, the Commission presented sufficient evidence of retaliatory intent, which 
under a proper instruction, might have resulted in a finding of liability.  
    
AutoZone's argument that it could not have retaliated against Wing because 
it made her full-time and promoted her to a commercial specialist job is similarly 
unavailing.  The fact that AutoZone officially placed Wing in full-time status and 
ultimately promoted her to a commercial specialist has no bearing on whether the 
company denied her promotion to the PSM job because of her protected conduct.  
III-SER-332; ESSER-27.   And there was no evidence that the commercialist 
specialist was at the same pay or status level as a PSM. ESSER-26. 
    
On the whole, none of AutoZone's arguments justify the exclusion of the 
denial of a promotion claim from the retaliation instruction.  The Commission was 
entitled to have a jury instruction tailored to the retaliation evidence and theories it 
presented at trial.  By excluding the denial of promotion claim from the jury 
instruction on retaliation, the district court misled the jury and did not permit it to 
consider that AutoZone also could be liable for retaliation if it denied Wing the 
promotion because of her protected activity.  Indeed, had they been properly 
instructed, they might have held AutoZone liable for retaliation, especially since 
such conclusion would not require a finding that Wing had held the position in the 
first place. EEOC Br. at 58-60.  This Court should therefore reject the arguments 
proffered by AutoZone, reverse the retaliation judgment in favor of AutoZone, and 
remand for a new trial on the retaliation claim.

                                 CONCLUSION
The Commission proposed a jury instruction on the denial claim that was 
supported by the evidence presented at trial and the court's improper restriction of 
the adverse action instruction to a withdrawal of a promotion substantially 
impacted the outcome of the case.  Accordingly, the EEOC urges this Court to 
reverse the retaliation judgment and remand this claim for a new trial.

<1> Rule 51(a)(1) indicates that a party may furnish written requests for a particular 
jury instruction at the close of evidence "or at any earlier reasonable time that the 
court orders."  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(a)(1).  

<2> In responding to the court's query, EEOC counsel also stated "I think that's the 
court's ruling." II-SER-71.  Thus, in referencing the court's ruling the Commission 
acknowledged that the court had definitively ruled on the matter when it previously 
issued retaliation instructions that restricted the adverse action to the withdrawal of 
promotion claim.   

<3> District manager Brian Goddard testified that Contreras, as a store manager, 
would have had to run all PSM hires through Goddard.  ESSER-36-37.   A jury 
could deduce from this evidence that Contreras played a key role in the 
determination as to whether Wing would be promoted.
